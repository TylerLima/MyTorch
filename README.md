Android Flashlight Application

Language:java
IDE: Android Studio

Description: Simple android app using toggle button coupled with 2 images displaying "on" or "off" for flashlight use.

Purpose: Determine how quickly I could pick up android app development. Flashlight app was a straightforward concept of creating a gui 
to access permissions like Camera.Flash. I also chose the flashlight app as my first app dev project because the Android app I 
used previously for a flashlight had advertisements I would constantly, accidentally click on. I also wanted the flashlight to stay on
when the screen was turned off.

Upcoming changes: Currently fixing the morse code flash feature, allowing the user to input a string no longer than 15 characters, and 
output a morse code of the String in flashes of light. Also looking to implement a strobe feature and a light intensity control button.
